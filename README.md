# User Stories
User stories are a great way to define the functionality and features of a shopping list app from the perspective of the end users. Here are some user stories for a shopping list app:
As a user, I want to be able to create a new shopping list so that I can organize and plan my shopping needs.

- As a user, I can register and create an account in the app.
- As a user, I can login or logout from the app, so that can view the list of items created by me only and no one else can access my list.
- As a user, I want to be able to add items to my shopping list to keep track of what I need to purchase.
- As a user, I should be able to click on the item in the list and see the details about that particular item.
- As a user, I can edit an item on the list that I added so that I can update or make changes to that item.
- As a user, I should be able to delete items added by me.
- As a user, I want to be able to mark items as purchased when I buy them, so I can keep my list up to date.
- As a user, I want to be able to easily search for items in my shopping list to quickly locate and manage them.
- As a user, I want to be able to view and edit my shopping list on multiple devices (e.g., smartphone, tablet, web browser) for convenience and accessibility.

# Wireframes 

Wireframes provide a visual representation of the app's layout and structure, making it easier to conceptualize and understand the overall design and functionality.
